Hadn't played at all in a week until tonite so was a bit rusty. But did OK. Couple things I'm struggling with:<br /><br />Robo in PvZ is not working out for me. I can't get any good timings that don't get easily countered. I seem to be doing much better with gateway armies and lots of pressure. I think I'd prefer to work on 6gate blink and <span style="font-style:italic;">then</span> transition into robo/collosi.<br /><br />PvT is causing me grief. I think it comes down to if I execute my build correctly, I absolutely need to attack when charge finishes. Even if I'm going straight into 2-base bunker defense.<br /><br />Strangely I'm winning almost all PvP. I think my micro is finally getting passable. At least in a few specific cases like defending a 4-gate.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6031401244193476560-2151772678665168179?l=moxysplayroom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
