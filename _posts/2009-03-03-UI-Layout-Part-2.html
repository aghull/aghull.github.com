Screenshots <a href="http://moxysplayroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/ui-layout.html">as promised</a> of my UI redesign over the weekend. I quite liked it during our excellent but unsuccessful 3 drake attempt. For comparison, here is the UI I had last week:<br /><br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TC-jtivlgIc/SazGU2-wg_I/AAAAAAAAAEI/duBxc0nSGbs/"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TC-jtivlgIc/SazGU2-wg_I/AAAAAAAAAEI/duBxc0nSGbs/s400/WoWScrnShot_011509_000356.jpg"/></a><br /><br />It's ok but there is a lot of wasted space that I was able to clean up. Here's how it looks now in combat:<br /><br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TC-jtivlgIc/SazGSR4CbJI/AAAAAAAAAEA/O3ml0pJsH0c/"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TC-jtivlgIc/SazGSR4CbJI/AAAAAAAAAEA/O3ml0pJsH0c/s400/WoWScrnShot_030209_214113.jpg"/></a><br /><br />And here's how it looks out of combat:<br /><br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TC-jtivlgIc/SazF13dfUXI/AAAAAAAAAD4/QFH1af25Szk/"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TC-jtivlgIc/SazF13dfUXI/AAAAAAAAAD4/QFH1af25Szk/s400/WoWScrnShot_030309_004109.jpg"/></a><br /><br />You can see how much space around my character has been cleared up while still retaining as much information as before. I'd like to tweak my scrolling text a but too now as well. I'm also trying out <a href="http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8418-GhostPulse.html">GhostPulse</a> to give me better cooldown notification. I didn't get much chance to configure it but it works pretty nice out of the box. <br /><br />The mods used are all pretty standard. If anyone's curious, here's the list:<br /><ul><li>Satrina's Buff Frames<br /><li>oRA<br /><li>Grid + various plugins<br /><li>Bartender<br /><li>Pitbull<br /><li>Recount<br /><li>Fubar<br /><li>Quartz<br /><li>Deadly Boss Mods<br /><li>Mik's Scrolling Battle Text</ul><br />Only SBF is a little unusual, and it's one I recommend trying if you haven't.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a gorgeous piece of art like some people's UI. I aim for functionality over visual fluff. But I'm always looking for new stuff to try. If you have any suggestions for improvements, lemme know.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6031401244193476560-3327239744376382700?l=moxysplayroom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
